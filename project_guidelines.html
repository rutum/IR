Your project will be graded on the following:
<ul>
    <li> Code/research: 15%
    <li> In-Class Presentation: 5%
    <li> Research Paper: 10%
</ul>
<hr>
You may do the project individually or as a team of 2 people if the project is complex (please make sure you run your topic by your professor first).
<br><br>
Your project should add new value to the community. It can be in the form of a prototype of a novel idea, a survey of current research, or implementation of a new library or software.
<br>
Here are some sample projects that you may chose from, or you could propose a topic that interests you.

<ol>
    <li> Book Search / Movie Search: Given a corpus of book reviews (or movie reviews), can you develop a search engine that can search for individual components of the book. E.g. female protagonist, funny and quirky etc?
    <li> Tech Item Search: If you are in the market to buy a tech product (such as camera), most websites will not help you compare based on attributes of the tech item - such as aperture of a lense, or memory of a computer. Can you build a search engine that can perform deep search?
    <li> Resource Comparison: There are several tools in the market for search engines. Lucene and Elastic Search dominate the search space. Is this because of good marketing, or are they good compared to other non JAVA tools. What are the importnat resources that are relevant in the IR space.
    <li>Search engine for wikipedia (or other corpora): Can you build a search engine that performs better than the current implementations?
</ol>
